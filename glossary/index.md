title: Glossary of Turing Specific Terms
---

You have probably heard the Turing team, students, and community members use unique vocabulary as they talk about the program. Over the years, Turing has created a set of terms that are specific to the organization and are used regularly on campus and within our community. Some terms were intentionally chosen, others evolved organically as our team named different things within the program. Below you will find a comprehensive list of the internal terms that are unique to Turing.

Please note that many, if not most, of our students come from industries outside of tech and may not know that these terms are not used widely in the industry. As a mentor, it may be helpful to remind them that they should provide context if they use these terms in an interview or networking environment.
