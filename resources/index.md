### Leading the Charge on Scheduling
<!-- * []() -->

It is strongly suggested that mentors set clear expectations with their mentees around consistent meeting times.

Students at Turing are often overwhelmed by the workload, and may not proactively schedule time with a mentor, despite how beneficial that time together is. Students often cite a concern of taking up too much of their mentors time or not wanting to be an imposition on their mentor as reasons they don't reach out to schedule time with you. It is not unlikely that you communicate to them several times that you _want_ to meet with them before they truly absorb it.

Please do not be discouraged if you find that you are leading the charge when it comes to coordinating meetings. The relationship a student builds with their mentor is incredibly valuable, and they may need clear and direct encouragement from you, their mentor, that it is ok to regularly prioritize time spent working with and talking to you.

### When to Check In

Instructors post the schedule for the entire module in advance, which can be found on each programâ€™s curriculum site as well as on this site's __Calendar__ and __Module Overviews__ sections. Mentors should aim to be conscious of key deadlines that will happen over the course of the module, namely:

* Project due dates
* Mid mods
* Final assessments, evals, and portfolio review

Suggested key conversations that will be beneficial to have with your mentee (templates to guide conversations can be found in the next section):

* Week 1: module kick off mentor + mentee DTR
* Week 3 or 4: mid-mod follow up
1. What feedback did your instructors give you
1. What were your areas of struggle/what are your focus areas for the second half of the inning?
1. What were your strengths?
* Week 6: module mentor + mentee exit DTR
