## Instructors

Hannah Hudson, Scott Ertmer, Kayla Wood

## Module Content Summary

JS, HTML, CSS, DOM basics

## Technical Focus of the Module

JS foundations, cultivating good problem solving skills (pseudo-coding, using docs, logical thinking), HTML/CSS, DOM vs data model

## Projects

<section>
  <a href="https://frontend.turing.io/projects/" class="btn btn-dark">Front End Projects</a>
</section>

* First solo: JS Fun at a Restaurant / JS Fun at the Library
* Paired: Hang In There / RomCom
* Second solo: Misc Solo Challenge (DOM Manipulation, HTML and CSS)
* Group: IdeaBox / Intention Timer (group)
* Final Solo: Tic Tac Toe / SlapJack

## Current project learning goals

* First solo: understanding simple and complex data types, declaring variables, unit testing (working with, NOT writing their own tests)
* Paired: write DRY js, understand class instantiation, manipulate DOM after page load, start understanding to write effective HTML/CSS
* Group: understanding data model vs DOM, advanced manipulation of DOM after page load, array iteration, refactoring, using local storage
* Final solo: writing DRY js, understanding data model vs DOM, iterating through DOM elements, using problem solving skills for tricky logic.


## Top three skills mentors should focus on with mentees

* Cultivating good problem solving skills (pseudo-coding, logging/debugging, researching docs, using terms of art to talk through code)
* JS fundamentals (args/params, working with arrays and objects/classes, refactoring)
* Data model vs DOM

## Any things that mentors should __not__ focus on or share with their mentees?

No looping array prototypes (Ex: reduce, map, forEach, etc). We want students to focus on using for statements to attain a thorough understanding of looping.

No destructuring. Students often don’t understand what destructuring does. When they use destructuring, they often don’t learn how to handle the passing in of an object as a function parameter.

No fat arrow functions. This is a big focus on M2, and we want to make sure they are comfortable with regular functions in M1.

Generally we stay away from ES6 JavaScript (Exceptions: template literals, ternaries)

## Common "gotchas" students encounter in this module

* The relationship between arguments and parameters, especially when instantiating a class and passing complex data
* Using the data model to keep track of an app’s data, instead of storing data on the DOM.
* HTML/CSS

## How does this module’s curriculum fit into the program as a whole __(help mentors to understand the “why” behind what is being taught)__

Building strong foundations for the rest of Turing and for on the job learning.

Problem solving skills they should take with them and build upon through the program.
