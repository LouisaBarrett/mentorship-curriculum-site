title: Front End Module 3
---

## Instructors

Khalid Williams, Leta Keane

## Module Content Summary

Students learn to use React, thereby building up understanding of JavaScript component frameworks, state, and asynchronous JS (querying APIs, building a basic server to better understand RESTful architecture and the request/response cycle).

They continue to build up their skills in independent learning: asking questions, reading documentation, trying out code, and problem solving.

## Technical Focus of the Module

* React
* asynchronous JS
* Testing async JS and React
* Express
* independent learning

[Binary Challenge](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-3/binary-challenge.html)

## Current project learning goals

Rancid Tomatillos:

* Get comfortable with writing React apps
* Consume data from / modify data on a server
* Learn to implement React Router
* Test the application with React Testing Library

Stretch:

* Continue to build on learning goals from above
* Research and implement a new technology independently

Binary Challenge (final):

* Demonstrate understanding of the above

## Top three skills mentors should focus on with mentees

* Understand the concept of application state, and where it is appropriately used
* Understand the concept of testing application front ends based on what the user sees / experiences ( React Testing Library’s testing philosophy)
* Understand the request/response cycle

## Any things that mentors should __not__ focus on or share with their mentees?

* React Hooks (we're teaching them class based components first; some students also choose to learn hooks)
* GraphQL

## Common "gotchas" students encounter in this module

* Testing asynchronous code with React Testing Library
* Testing components that use React Router with React Testing Library
* Understanding where to place state in a React application
* Understanding and writing integration tests with React Testing Libraries

## How does this module’s curriculum fit into the program as a whole __(help mentors to understand the “why” behind what is being taught)__

* Mod 3’s curriculum takes the programming / JS fundamentals students have been learning in modules 1 and 2, and applies them to modern development tools and processes.
* Students build out applications on a modern frontend framework (React), implement routing (React Router), fully test their applications (React Testing Library), and continues to build their understanding of how the backend fits into what they’ve been learning (building out Express servers).
* Mod 3 also presents opportunities for students to differentiate their work/interests/career goals in the last two projects.
